# ErnstHartert

`ErnstHartert`, named after German ornithologist of the same name, is a tool for generating `main.swift` files for use with XCTest on Linux. It generates extensions on your project's `XCTestCase` subclasses that add the `allTests` variable, and it also includes a call to `XCTMain()` as well.
